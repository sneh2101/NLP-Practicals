A beautiful place to dine in.The interiors take you back to the Mughal era.
The lightings are just perfect.We went there on the occasion of Christmas and so they had only limited items available.
But the taste and service was not compromised at all.The only complaint is that the breads could have been better.
Would surely like to come here again.I was here for dinner with my family on a weekday. 
The restaurant was completely empty. 
Ambience is good with some good old hindi music. 
Seating arrangement are good too. 
We ordered masala papad, panner and baby corn starters, lemon and corrionder soup, butter roti, olive and chilli paratha. 
Food was fresh and good, service is good too. Good for family hangout.Cheers'Its a restaurant near to Banashankari BDA.
Me along with few of my office friends visited to have buffet but unfortunately they only provide veg buffet. 
On inquiring they said this place is mostly visited by vegetarians. Anyways we ordered ala carte items which took ages to come.
Food was ok ok. Definitely not visiting anymore.
We went here on a weekend and one of us had the buffet while two of us took Ala Carte. 
Firstly the ambience and service of this place is great! The buffet had a lot of items and the good was good. 
We had a Pumpkin Halwa intm the dessert which was amazing.
